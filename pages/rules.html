        <h2>About the game</h2>
        <p>Equally well known as Twenty-One. The rules are simple, the play is thrilling, and there is opportunity for high
          strategy. In fact, for the expert player who mathematically plays a perfect game and is able to count cards, the
          odds are sometimes in that player's favor to win.

          But even for the casual participant who plays a reasonably good game, the casino odds are less, making
          Blackjack one of the most attractive casino games for the player. While the popularity of Blackjack dates
          from World War I, its roots go back to the 1760s in France, where it is called Vingt-et-Un (French for 21).
          Today, Blackjack is the one card game that can be found in every American gambling casino. As a popular
          home game, it is played with slightly different rules. In the casino version, the house is the dealer (a
          "permanent bank"). In casino play, the dealer remains standing, and the players are seated. The dealer is in
          charge of running all aspects of the game, from shuffling and dealing the cards to handling all bets. In the
          home game, all of the players have the opportunity to be the dealer (a "changing bank").</p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>Each player sitting at the table places their desired bet in the betting circle directly in front of them.
        In most casinos if there are untaken betting circles, the players sitting at the table can choose to play more than
        one hand at a time. The minimum and maximum bet size varies from casino to casino, generally with a ratio of 40 to
        100 between them. For example with a $25 minimum bet the maximum will usually be somewhere from $1000 to $2500. Once
         the bets are placed the dealer will move their hand across the table from their left to their right signalling that
          no further bets can be placed. The dealer then deals cards one at a time clockwise around the table, from the
          dealer's left to the dealer's right: first a card face up to each betting circle that has a bet in it, then a card
          face up to the dealer, and then a second card face up to each betting circle with a bet and finally a second card
           face down to the dealer. </p>

      <h2>Player actions</h2>
      <p>HIT: Request another card. You can request a hit as many times as you like, but if your total
        goes over 21, you will Bust and therfore lose the hand.</p>
       <br>
       <p>STAND: Request that you receive no more cards. Your current hand will be judged against the dealer's.</p>
       <br>
       <p>DOUBLE: If you select this option, you will get exactly one more card, your turn will end, and your bet will
         be doubled. Note: this option will normally only be available immediately after you receive your first two cards,
          however, Doubling after Splitting is usually allowed.</p>
          <p>When the dealer has served every player, his face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, he
             must stand. If the total is 16 or under, he must take a card. He must continue to take cards until the total
             is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would
              bring his total to 17 or more (but not over 21), he must count the ace as 11 and stand. The dealer's decisions
              , then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.</p>
